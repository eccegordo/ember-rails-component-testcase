A minimalist rails app using ember rails.

This is to demonstrate the use of components per the Ember JS guide

http://emberjs.com/guides/components/defining-a-component/

This app does nothing in particular but attempt to define handlebars component at

app/assets/javscripts/component/foo.hbs

and display the component in the application handlebars template at

app/assets/javscripts/templates/application.hbs
